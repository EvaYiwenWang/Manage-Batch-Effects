# Examples of microbiome studies with batch effects 

This vignette provides all the analyses performed in the paper 'Managing Batch Effects in Microbiome Data'.

**Packages installation and loading**

First, you will need to install then load the following packages:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# cran.packages <- c('knitr', 'mixOmics', 'xtable', 'ggplot2', 'vegan', 'cluster',
#                   'gridExtra', 'pheatmap', 'ruv', 'lmerTest', 'bapred')
# install.packages(cran.packages)
# bioconductor.packages <- c('sva', 'limma', 'AgiMicroRna', 
#                           'variancePartition', 'pvca')
# if (!requireNamespace('BiocManager', quietly = TRUE))
#     install.packages('BiocManager')
# BiocManager::install(bioconductor.packages, version = '3.8')

library(knitr)
library(xtable) # table
library(mixOmics)
library(sva) # ComBat
library(ggplot2) # PCA sample plot with density
library(gridExtra) # PCA sample plot with density
library(limma) # removeBatchEffect (LIMMA)
library(vegan) # RDA
library(AgiMicroRna) # RLE plot
library(cluster) # silhouette coefficient

```

## Study description          

### Sponge *Aplysina aerophoba* study

Sacristán-Soriano *et al.* studied the potential involvement of bacterial communities from the sponge species *A. aerophoba* in the biosynthesis of brominated alkaloids (BAs) [@sacristan2011exploring]. They compared the microbial composition and BA concentration in two different tissues (ectosome and choanosome) to investigate the relationship between bacterial composition and BA concentration. The authors concluded that differences in bacterial profiles were not only due to tissue variation (the main effect of interest), but also because the samples were run on two separate denaturing gradient gels during processing. Gel thus acted as a technical batch effect as described in Table 1. 

### Anaerobic digestion study

Anaerobic Digestion (AD) is a microbiological process of organic matter degradation that produces a biogas used in electrical and thermal energy production. However, the AD bioprocess undergoes inhibition during its developmental stage that is not well characterised: Chapleur *et al.* explored microbial indicators that could improve the AD bioprocess's efficacy and prevent its failure [@chapleur2016increasing]. They profiled the microbiota of 75 AD samples in various conditions. Here we consider two different ranges of phenol concentration as treatments. The experiment was conducted at different dates (5), which constitutes a technical source of unwanted variation (Table 1).

### Huntington's disease study

In their study, Kong *et al.* reported differences in microbial composition between Huntington's disease (HD) and wild-type (WT) mice [@kong2018microbiome]. However, the establishment of microbial communities was also driven by biological batch effects: the cage environment and sex. Here we consider only female mice to illustrate a special case of a batch $\times$ treatment unbalanced design. The HD data include 13 faecal mice samples hosted across 4 cages (Table 1).

We load the data and functions that are provided *outside* the packages. 

```{r}
# load the data
load(file = './datasets/microbiome_datasets.RData')

# load the extra functions
source(file = './Functions.R')
dim(sponge.tss)
dim(ad.count)
dim(hd.count)
```

**Note:** the AD data and HD data loaded are raw counts, while sponge data are total sum scaling (TSS) scaled data calculated on raw counts, with no offset. 

## Data processing

**Data processing steps for microbiome data**:   

1. Prefilter the count data to remove features with excess zeroes across all samples        
2. Add an offset of 1 to the whole data matrix       
3. Total Sum Scaling transformation         
4. Log-ratio transformation           

### Prefiltering

We use a prefiltering step to remove OTUs for which the sum of counts are below a set threshold (0.01%) compared to the total sum of all counts from [@arumugam2011enterotypes].

```{r}
# ad data
ad.index.keep <- which(colSums(ad.count)*100/(sum(colSums(ad.count))) > 0.01)
ad.count.keep <- ad.count[, ad.index.keep]
dim(ad.count.keep)

# hd data
#hd.index.keep <- which(colSums(hd.count)*100/(sum(colSums(hd.count))) > 0.001)
hd.count.keep <- hd.count
dim(hd.count.keep)
```
Compared with the raw counts, many OTUs below the threshold are removed. As HD data are small part of a big dataset and only have 13 samples, it is too strict to use the threshold 0.01% to filter the OTUs. We then maintained all the OTUs in HD data.

### Total sum scaling

Now, let’s apply a TSS scaling on the filtered data:

**Note:** We need to add an offset of 1 to all count data (i.e. count data = count.keep + 1). Although sponge data are already TSS data, a 'tiny' offset is added and then TSS is redone. Because the presence of zeroes will make the next step (log-ratio transformation) impossible. 

```{r}
# sponge data
sponge.tss <- t(apply(sponge.tss + 0.01, 1, TSS.divide))

# ad data
ad.tss <- t(apply(ad.count.keep + 1, 1, TSS.divide))

# hd data
hd.tss <- t(apply(hd.count.keep + 1, 1, TSS.divide))
```

We then check the library size that sums to 1 for each sample. We now have compositional data.

```{r}
# sponge data
sponge.lib.size.tss <- apply(sponge.tss, 1, sum)
barplot(sponge.lib.size.tss, main =  'Sponge data', las = 2)

# ad data
ad.lib.size.tss <- apply(ad.tss, 1, sum)
barplot(ad.lib.size.tss, main =  'AD data', las = 2)


# hd data
hd.lib.size.tss <- apply(hd.tss, 1, sum)
barplot(hd.lib.size.tss, main =  'HD data', las = 2)
```

### Centered log-ratio transformation

TSS results in compositional data (or proportions) that are restricted to a space where the sum of all OTU proportions for a given sample sums to 1. Using standard statistical methods on such data may lead to spurious results and therefore the data must be further transformed. The CLR is the transformation of choice.

```{r}
# sponge data
sponge.tss.clr <- logratio.transfo(sponge.tss, logratio = 'CLR')
class(sponge.tss.clr) <- 'matrix' 

# ad data
ad.tss.clr <- logratio.transfo(ad.tss, logratio = 'CLR')
class(ad.tss.clr) <- 'matrix' 

# hd data
hd.tss.clr <- logratio.transfo(hd.tss, logratio = 'CLR')
class(hd.tss.clr) <- 'matrix'
```

The final TSS-CLR data of sponge study, AD study and HD study contain 32 samples and 24 OTUs, 75 samples and 231 OTUs, 13 samples and 368 OTUs, respectively as described in Table 1.

**Table 1. Overview of exemplar datasets with batch effects.** We considered microbiome studies from sponge *Aplysina aerophoba*; organic matter in anaerobic
digestion (AD) and mice models with Huntington’s disease (HD).
